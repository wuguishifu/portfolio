# Bo Bramer's Portfolio Website

This website uses React + Typescript + Vite + Tailwindcss. This is the third iteration of my portfolio website, and I'm hosting it in AWS using an S3 bucket for static hosting. To cache website data and take advantage of a generous free tier, I'm using a CloudFront distribution to front the S3 bucket, and I'm using a Route53 hosted zone to take advantage of my custom domain.
